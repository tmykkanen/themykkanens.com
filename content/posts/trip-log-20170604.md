Today was our first full day in Dublin. And it was full indeed. I got my first taste of Irish breakfast at the hotel (bangers, beans, bacon, tomatoes, blood sausage, egg). Then we departed for church service. My group attended [City Church Dublin] (http://www.citychurchdublin.ie) just across the River Liffey from our hotel. We sang together and Pastor Mark preached from Acts 21. City Church Dublin is a small church plant in the heart of the city. The congregation is multi-national since many are students in one of the local universities.

After the service, the congregation hosted us for lunch. I met David, who told me about his work with the homeless in Dublin. Homelessness and drug addiction are significant problems in the city.

In the afternoon, we met at [Immanuel Church Dublin] (http://www.immanuelchurchdublin.org) to rehearse and pray with local Christians, then we hit the streets. At Immanuel, I met a couple from Minnesota in Dublin for PhD work. The choir sang in two locations along O'Connel Street and Grafton Street. Music in the streets is very common in Dublin, with many people busking (singing for money) full-time. While the choir sang, several of us mingled in the crowd talking to people and sharing our faith. Some good conversations took place with local pastors providing follow-up.

After a debrief meal, I got some time with Mark and Kieron, two of the pastors I planned to meet here. We didn't get much time to talk today (we're meeting later in the week), but something they both emphasized was the need for long-term workers. Everyone I've talked to over here says "burning the boats" is very important. The ground is hard and the work is slow, so it's better to stay away unless I can make a long-term commitment. This doesn't put me off, but it does highlight the need to count the cost.

Our final experience for the evening was unplanned. Hannah (our harpist) was walking by a pub when the musicians inside noticed her and waved her in. Hannah and Jennifer (our fiddler) spent the next hour and a half jamming with musicians to Irish pub songs. It was brilliant.
