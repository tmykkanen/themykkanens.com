The morning of June 13th, we left Buncrana to travel back to Dublin. By this time in the trip, I was beginning to get sick. Unfortunately, most of the rest of our time in Dublin I was sick and exhausted. This trip was very busy and full.

I managed to meet with Kieron one more time in Dublin and he gave me some excellent questions to consider in the coming months.

Our travel home was grueling as well. We had a scheduled four hour layover in Amsterdam, but the flight was further delayed two hours. Between the layover and delay and just regular travel time, our team was up for 23 hours before arriving home to MSP. I was ready to be home and see Nicole and the kiddos by the time I arrived. They greeted me at the airport with big hugs and a lovely sign and cards when I got home.

In the next post, I will share my reflections and lessons learned from the many meetings I had while in Ireland.
