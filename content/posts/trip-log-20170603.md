Yesterday, we departed for Ireland. We met at the airport at 7pm and Pastors David Livingston and Daniel Viezbicke exhorted us from the word and prayed for us. Saying goodbye to family was difficult. The kids handled it pretty well (though Ruby pointed out that we could have sprung to bring a few more kiddos with on the trip). The flight was good. This was my first time flying international. "Waking up" after only a few hours of sleep and finding out I lost seven hours by crossing time zones was very surreal. Thankfully, God sustained all of us even though we were tired. We landed in Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, which is pretty much like a giant Ikea. We spent our three hour layover fueling up with Starbucks and pondering why all the money amounts had commas after two digits. Then we flew KLM on a one hour hop to Dublin. The weather in Dublin was beautifully moody. After unpacking, several of us walked around downtown to get some fresh air before crashing. Samuel (our guide) advised us to stay awake as long as possible to minimize the effects of jet-lag. After a long day of traveling, we were especially thankful for a hot shower and a soft bed.
