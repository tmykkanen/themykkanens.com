This morning, we left Belfast for Derry. We took the Antrim Coast road, which goes along the northern coast of Ireland. All of Ireland is beautiful, but this part is superlatively beautiful. The landscape along the coast is what most of us picture when think of Ireland.

First we stopped in Larne and sang Amazing Grace around an Irish flag for a drone shot. Then we drove further up the coast and stopped above the [Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrick-a-Rede_Rope_Bridge). Unfortunately, we did not have time to go down and cross the bridge. We continued on and had lunch at the [Red Door Tea Room] (https://www.facebook.com/thereddoortearoom/), where David's (our vidographer) car got a flat. Thankfully, Doug was able to break the lug nuts free and we were moving again. The highlight of the coastal road was stopping at [Giant's Causeway] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant%27s_Causeway). We weren't allowed to do a drone shot there, but the choir sang several songs and we explored the fascinating rock formations.

After Giant's Causeway, we drove the rest of the way to Derry. Part of Derry is completely enclosed in walls built in the 17th century. In the evening we toured some of the city and I learned I would be preaching on Sunday, so I spent the rest of the evening working on prepping a sermon from Colossians 1:1-8.
