Today is Sunday. While the choir left to sing at [St. Columb's Cathedral] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Columb%27s_Cathedral), I stayed at the hotel and worked on my sermon for this evening. Our hotel was inside the city walls near a memorial in the center of the old city. While working on my sermon, I heard music coming from the square. It seems there was some kind of memorial service that morning. I enjoyed listening to it while I finished sermon prep.

The choir returned to the hotel a bit after lunch time and Ruth and Andrew met us with bag lunches. They were very gracious hosts and had arranged for us to experience some traditional Irish music near Buncrana. We traveled about 45 min north and stopped at [Glendowen Craft Studio] (https://www.facebook.com/glendowencraftshop/) to shop locally made goods and listen to the Irish music group [Reel Trad] (https://www.facebook.com/people/Reel-Trad/100009037575027). Ann and the rest of the folks at the shop welcomed us warmly with coffee and tea.

Later that evening, after checking into the hotel, we ate dinner at the beautiful [Beach House Bar & Restaurant] (http://thebeachhouse.ie/) right on the shore of Lough Swilly. The sky was overcast, but across the lough, the sun poked through the clouds and created highlights on the low hills. It was breathtaking.

After dinner, we went to a small gathering of local believers and celebrated Jesus through musical worship, preaching, and communion. I preached on Colossians 1:3-8 and highlighted how communities with strong faith in Christ Jesus and love for one another are built through setting our hope on the gospel of Jesus Christ. The sermon was not recorded, but upon returning home I preached a similar message at Word of Grace which you can hear [here] (http://wordofgracebaptist.org/sermons/2017/6/23/colossians-118). The whole service was moving as Irish and American believers came together around a common love for Jesus.
