Today, the choir sang in [Christ Church Cathedral] (http://christchurchcathedral.ie/). The cathedral is straight across the street from our hotel and is a beautiful and historic building. The choir sang well and the performance was well received. The cathedral is a reverent place, so songs like O Nata Lux were especially beautiful in that context. After singing in the cathedral, we participated in a tour. During the tour, we climbed 800 year old stairs to get to the bell tower. Here we had a chance to ring the bells. Then the guide took us down into the crypt where we saw the famous [mummified cat and rat] (http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/christ-church-cathedral-dublin). According to legend, the cat chased the rat into an organ pipe and mummified after becoming stuck and dying.

Earlier this morning, I met with Kieron Lynch, pastor of [Immanuel Church Dublin] (http://www.immanuelchurchdublin.org). Our time was fruitful and encouraging. I will reflect more on the take-aways from my many meetings in a different post.

This evening, we ate dinner at the [Brazen Head] (http://www.brazenhead.com/), Irelandâ€™s oldest pub. Our host, Johnny, entertained us with stories of Food, Folklore, and Fairies.

Both of these venues highlight the extreme antiquity of Dublin (especially compared to the United States). For example, part of Christ Church collapsed and was rebuilt around the time our country was going through the Civil War. Seeing these things puts history into perspective and reminds me that many things in the past are not that long ago. In Ireland, the Troubles were only a generation ago, and much of the pain is still present and significantly impacts evangelism and church planting.
