Paul here relates his suffering and toil directly to the lives of the Colossian believers. Paul is not looking for sympathy or pity, but is telling his story “that [your] hearts may be encouraged” (2:2). This seems counter-intuitive. Many of us have experienced someone telling us how hard they worked for our benefit. Those of us who are parents have probably told our kids how great our struggle was on their behalf. This most likely wasn’t meant for their encouragement, however.

So how are Paul’s words meant to encourage the Colossian believers? Paul’s struggle is encouraging because of the end goal: “to reach all the riches of full assurance” (2:2). Paul wants the Colossian believers to be fully assured that they are in Christ. This full assurance will lead to their joy because “all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” are in Christ (2:3). In Colossae, false teachers are trying to convince believers that they need Jesus + _____. Paul wants the believers to stand assured that in Jesus, they have access to all wisdom and knowledge. Paul’s perseverance in joyful suffering and toil communicates to the Colossians his confidence in the Christ Jesus as the hope of glory.

As we labor in Ireland, how much are we willing to struggle and toil? How sure are we that Jesus is enough to change hardened hearts and encourage weakened believers? How sure are we that Jesus is enough to heal the deep emotional wounds in this country? The wisdom of the world can offer plausible arguments for why Jesus is not enough. We must be fully assured that he is enough. By our confident toiling, we must communicate to our Irish brothers and sisters that Jesus alone holds all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

*	What are some “plausible arguments” the world might offer against the sufficiency of Jesus?
*	Paul never met the church at Colossae. What can we learn from Paul about ministering to and encouraging people we have never met?

_Jesus our treasure, you are the source and possessor and giver of all wisdom and knowledge. We desperately need both as we minister to one another and to the Irish peoples on this trip. Grant us an abundance of both and use us as instruments to strengthen the confidence of the believers we encounter. Amen._
