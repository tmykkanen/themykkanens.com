We are blessed and thankful for your desire to partner with us as we obey God’s call on our lives. You can partner with us in the following ways.

### Pray for and with us

This is by far the most significant way you can partner with us during this time. We serve a sovereign and good God who know’s our needs and desires before we ask him and works all things for our good and His Glory. Yet he often chooses to perform that working through the prayers of His saints.

That I would seek first to serve in my family, at school, at Bethlehem Baptist Church, and in the world. That Nicole would be comforted and strengthened as she transitions from the familiar to the unfamiliar. That Nicole would trust me and the goodness of Christ for daily grace. That the children would embrace the newness in their lives and turn to God who provides help in time of need. That the children would feel God’s love for them through us and through the church body.</span>

That Bethlehem Baptist church would shine as a light for the gospel in the community of Minneapolis and God would provide opportunity for many to come to know Him.</span>

### Share the cost

Seminary is valuable training for pastors, but that training comes at a significant financial cost. BCS is distinctive in it’s low cost. Tuition at the school is subsidized heavily by individual and church donors. The tuition cost for a four year MDiv program is approximately $20,000 ($5,000/year). Tuition for comparable seminaries such as Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary averages $40,000 to $50,000\. In addition to tuition are the costs of books and support materials as well as daily living expenses. Due to the significant class load required, I will only be able to work part time while attending. Nicole will also be re-entering the workforce during this time. We are grateful that God has given us the ability to work and are confident that He will provide for our needs and enable us to be content in whatever state we find ourselves in. We can do all things through Him who gives us strength. We will gladly pay the cost to serve our Lord. If God has blessed you with more than you need and you feel a desire to share this cost with us, you can do so in the following ways.

*   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Tuition** </span>- BCS incorporates the ability for donors to pay directly to the institution. You can do so by following [this link](https://bcs.populiweb.com/bookstore/student_charges.php?accessKey=33164a7446641ccbe330e5d889287d5c223faa1b7633cb0fd68006211b3dab05485dd190341b2b733a26de4086a72d1debfba319b8e9ac3bad6c).
*   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Living Expenses**</span> - Every amount given towards living expenses reduces the amount of hours Nicole and I need to work and frees us up for more time spent in direct ministry work, family time, or study. ![](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif)
