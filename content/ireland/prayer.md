I encourage you to pray Colossians 1:9–12 over our team. Pray that knowledge of the will of God would guide our team in all we say and do (1:9). Pray that we may walk worthy of the Lord and so: (1) bear fruit in good works (1:10a); (2) increase in the knowledge of God (1:10b); (3) be strengthened for endurance and patience (1:11); and (4) give joyful thanks to God (1:12). Pray that our worthy manner of walking would testify to the goodness of Jesus to those we encounter. Pray that endurance, patience, and joyful thanksgiving would mark our team’s interpersonal relationships. And give thanks to God that the gospel is moving in Ireland (Col 1:3–8).
