This June, I am traveling with the Bethlehem Baptist Church choir to proclaim the name of Jesus in Ireland. I will provide pastoral leadership for our team, deliver gospel teachings, and meet with Irish church leaders, missionaries, and planters.

Ireland is a land of remarkable beauty and history. The Irish people are welcoming and warm hearted. Yet, for all the beauty and cultural richness, Ireland is a land of deep suffering. The divide separating the island into two nations is strong. Political and religious identities are difficult to separate, confusing the Irish people about the nature of the true gospel. People who desperately need the healing Jesus brings want nothing to do with the church.

Ireland needs churches that clearly proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ while winsomely engaging the complex culture. One way to meet the deep spiritual needs in Ireland is through the work of church planting.

Church planting is one of the most strategic means God uses to proclaim his gospel among all nations. Pastor Tim Keller writes, “The vigorous, continual planting of new congregations is the single most crucial strategy for 1) the numerical growth of the body of Christ in any city, and 2) the continual corporate renewal and revival of the existing churches in a city.”

Our prayer is that this trip will bear near and long-term fruit for Jesus’s glory in Ireland. Near-term, we will use the gifts of music and the Word to encourage local believers and to share the gospel with unbelievers. Long-term, we hope to build gospel partnerships for church planting efforts. As my family considers church planting in Ireland, this trip will enable me to get the “lay of the land” by learning where and how we could best serve.

Please consider partnering with me in this ministry through financial generosity and prayer.

For the sake of the name of Jesus,

Tyler Mykkanen
