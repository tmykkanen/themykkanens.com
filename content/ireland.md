I am excited to share with you of my upcoming trip to Ireland from June 2-15, 2017. I am traveling with the Bethlehem Baptist Church South Campus choir as we partner with EdenGate Travel & Missions to proclaim the name of Jesus in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. I will provide pastoral leadership to the team, prepare and deliver gospel messages, and meet with Irish church leaders, missionaries, and church planters.

This trip will bear both near-term and long-term fruit for the glory of Jesus in Ireland. Near-term, we will use the gifts of music and word to strengthen and encourage local believers and share the gospel with unbelievers. Long-term, we will build gospel partnerships for church planting efforts. My family is considering church planting in Ireland in the future. Through relationships with local ministry workers, this trip will enable me to “get the lay of the land” by learning where and how we could be of most help.
