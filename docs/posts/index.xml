      <description>After posting online, God used the generosity of donors to bring my funding for Ireland from 45% to 80% in a matter of days. I am so very grateful to all who have donated and all who are praying for the rest of the funds to come in and for the trip to have success.
I have also made some good contacts in Ireland and have a better idea of when and where I will be meeting with folks.</description>
