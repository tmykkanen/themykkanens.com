      <description>By supporting Christian workers who go out “for the sake of the name,” you become a “fellow worker for the truth” (3 John 7–8). The cost of my trip is $3,700. This is a small amount if 100 of us share the cost. I’ve already invested my $37. Would you consider joining me by investing $37 or more to support our gospel work in Ireland? You can give online at http://bit.</description>

      <description>I encourage you to pray Colossians 1:9–12 over our team. Pray that knowledge of the will of God would guide our team in all we say and do (1:9). Pray that we may walk worthy of the Lord and so: (1) bear fruit in good works (1:10a); (2) increase in the knowledge of God (1:10b); (3) be strengthened for endurance and patience (1:11); and (4) give joyful thanks to God (1:12).</description>

      <description>This June, I am traveling with the Bethlehem Baptist Church choir to proclaim the name of Jesus in Ireland. I will provide pastoral leadership for our team, deliver gospel teachings, and meet with Irish church leaders, missionaries, and planters.
Ireland is a land of remarkable beauty and history. The Irish people are welcoming and warm hearted. Yet, for all the beauty and cultural richness, Ireland is a land of deep suffering.</description>

      <description>I am grateful to the Lord for allowing me to set aside time for focused and intensive study into His Word and for the Godly men I will be learning from at Bethlehem College and Seminary. As Nicole and I prayerfully considered which seminary would best prepare me for future ministry, BCS was distinctive in several key areas.
 Church Embedded - BCS is tightly integrated with the daily life of Bethlehem Baptist Church.</description>

      <description>Nicole and I met in middle school through a mutual friend. We lived in different cities, but often visited each other. We steadily grew in our friendship and eventually married the summer after graduation from High School. During the early years of our marriage, Nicole worked at Taste of Seattle as a Baker and I went to school at Saint Cloud State University for a B.S. in Special Education. Our dream was to start a family and in 2006 we had our first child, Malachi.</description>
