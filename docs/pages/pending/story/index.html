              <p>Nicole and I met in middle school through a mutual friend. We lived in different cities, but often visited each other. We steadily grew in our friendship and eventually married the summer after graduation from High School. During the early years of our marriage, Nicole worked at Taste of Seattle as a Baker and I went to school at Saint Cloud State University for a B.S. in Special Education. Our dream was to start a family and in 2006 we had our first child, Malachi. I began teaching in the public school system and Nicole stayed at home to take care of Malachi. In 2007, we welcomed Ruby to our family and in 2009 we welcomed Eleanora.</p>

<p>Nicole and I envisioned our future as being very similar to our situation at the time. We had no desire to move from the Saint Cloud area. We were very involved in the life of our church and considered them our family. I was planning to teach for 30+ years and then retire. Into this preconception, God started to bring a different vision for our future.</p>

<p>Shortly before our marriage, I began attending Communion Life Fellowship. Nicole grew up in this church and the pastor, Harold Wiehoff, gave us pre-marriage counseling. The church was smaller than the one’s I grew up in and the theology was different. Harold focused on expositional teaching from scripture and heavily emphasized God’s sovereignty and grace. This was a period of growth for Nicole and I relationally and spiritually as we examined together the doctrines of grace and started to form a deeper understanding of what the Bible says about our sin, God’s holiness, Christ’s redemption, and our calling as people saved by His grace.</p>

<p>God began stirring my heart with increased love for the local church and an increasing desire to serve the people in the church. The desire was small at first, but steadily grew as I became more involved relationally in the body and found opportunities to serve others and share the love of Christ with them. At the same time, God was growing Nicole’s ability and desire to speak the truth in love to other mothers through involvement in MOPS and Saint Cloud MOMS Club. We became more certain of a call to increased ministry in the church, but remained unsure of what form that ministry would take.</p>

<p>Through prayer and council from wise friends and family, our general sense of call progressed to a specific call to vocational pastoral ministry for me. As this call solidified, God put us through a period of waiting over several years. I continued to teach school and we focused on growing in our marriage, as parents, and in our maturity in Christ through involvement with our family at Communion Life Fellowship. As we explored options to pursue my sense of call, we were increasingly convinced of the benefit setting aside time for formal seminary training would bring. With prayer and counsel, we determined to sell our home and apply to seminary. We were accepted to Bethlehem College and Seminary in Minneapolis, MN.</p>

<p>This brings us to now. We are excited to embark on this new journey. We are eager to see how God will grow us in this new stage in life and to be further prepared for serving His church for His glory.</p>
