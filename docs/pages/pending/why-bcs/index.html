<p>I am grateful to the Lord for allowing me to set aside time for focused and intensive study into His Word and for the Godly men I will be learning from at <a href="http://bethlehemcollegeandseminary.org">Bethlehem College and Seminary</a>. As Nicole and I prayerfully considered which seminary would best prepare me for future ministry, BCS was distinctive in several key areas.</p>

<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Church Embedded</strong></span> - BCS is tightly integrated with the daily life of <a href="http://www.hopeingod.org/">Bethlehem Baptist Church</a>. The seminary was started by the church and seminarians serve within the church as part of the church body. This keeps the learning in classes directly linked to serving the body of Christ and helps us to remember that the purpose of this time of training goes beyond academic knowledge.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cohort Based</strong></span> - BCS accepts a limited number of seminary students each year (usually around 15). The men I will be taking classes with and ministering with and learning from will be together for the next four years. Our course load is also identical. This promotes discussions, debates, and encouragements to come from the depth of relationships built over time and through shared experiences.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Academically </strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rigorous</span> </strong>- Expectations for academic excellence are high. Greek and Hebrew language classes are held throughout the course of the four years. We will be taught to think deeply about what God’s Word says and to apply it with passion to our lives and the lives of those around us. We will also be examining  the history of the church and the saint who have gone before us.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mentorship Emphasis</strong></span> - I have been significantly impacted in my life by the mentoring of several men over the years. BCS emphasizes the importance of mentorship, referring to seminary students as “apprentices” and assigning us pastoral mentors. We can learn from these men who have many years of wisdom and ministry experience. We will also be engaged in mentoring students attending BCS at the undergraduate level to build our skill and experience in discipling others.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Financial Advantage</strong></span> - Nicole and I desire to remain out of debt throughout seminary and thereafter in order to improve opportunities for ministry. We wish to be free to minister wherever God would call us without the need to consider how to pay off student loans. BCS is very affordable compared to many other top seminaries. For more information on financial matters, please visit the partner with us page.</li>
