      <description>After posting online, God used the generosity of donors to bring my funding for Ireland from 45% to 80% in a matter of days. I am so very grateful to all who have donated and all who are praying for the rest of the funds to come in and for the trip to have success.
I have also made some good contacts in Ireland and have a better idea of when and where I will be meeting with folks.</description>

      <description>By supporting Christian workers who go out “for the sake of the name,” you become a “fellow worker for the truth” (3 John 7–8). The cost of my trip is $3,700. This is a small amount if 100 of us share the cost. I’ve already invested my $37. Would you consider joining me by investing $37 or more to support our gospel work in Ireland? You can give online at http://bit.</description>

      <description>I encourage you to pray Colossians 1:9–12 over our team. Pray that knowledge of the will of God would guide our team in all we say and do (1:9). Pray that we may walk worthy of the Lord and so: (1) bear fruit in good works (1:10a); (2) increase in the knowledge of God (1:10b); (3) be strengthened for endurance and patience (1:11); and (4) give joyful thanks to God (1:12).</description>

      <description>This June, I am traveling with the Bethlehem Baptist Church choir to proclaim the name of Jesus in Ireland. I will provide pastoral leadership for our team, deliver gospel teachings, and meet with Irish church leaders, missionaries, and planters.
Ireland is a land of remarkable beauty and history. The Irish people are welcoming and warm hearted. Yet, for all the beauty and cultural richness, Ireland is a land of deep suffering.</description>
