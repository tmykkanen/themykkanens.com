      <description>Up to this point in the letter, Paul primarily emphasized the lordship of Christ over the lives of the saints and in the church. Now Paul shifts his attention to the mission of the church in evangelism. He highlights the role of prayer and godly conduct in gospel witness. Paul shows his concern that the gospel continues to bear fruit and increase in the world (1:5–6).
He first calls the saints to prayer.</description>

      <description>After exhorting believers to submit to the lordship of Christ in everything (3:17), Paul turns to the Christian household. This section, known as the household codes, seems like a digression from Paul’s train of thought. However, we will see that these codes are a direct implication of the Christian’s new heavenward orientation in submission to Christ.
Paul addresses three pairs of people: wives and husbands, children and fathers, and slaves and masters.</description>

      <description>Finished with the old nature, Paul flips the coin over and examines our new nature in Christ Jesus. Love for one another and submission to Christ&amp;rsquo;s lordship characterizes this new nature.
Paul calls the Colossians to put on the new nature. The virtues he lists are not unique to Christianity. People can be compassionate, kind, and so on, without loving Jesus. What is unique about this list is the modifiers. The saints are to put on “as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved.</description>

      <description>Paul shifts his gaze from looking to heaven to looking to earth. Here he explains to the Colossians how a life hid with Christ in God works while still here on earth. Paul begins with three negative imperatives: 1) put to death, 2) put away, and 3) do not lie.
Paired with the first two imperatives, Paul provides two lists of sins. At first glance the lists may seem arbitrary, but they are not.</description>

      <description>In Colossians 3, Paul shifts his focus from the shadows of the earthly false teachers to the reality of the risen Christ. “If then you have been raised with Christ,” (3:1) parallels his statement in Colossians 2:20: “If with Christ you died.” Paul asserts both are true for the Colossian believers and the statements that follow unpack this significance. Since the believers in Colossae have been raised with Christ, their focus should be heavenward.</description>

      <description>All who love Jesus want to obey God’s commandments and grow in holiness and wisdom. This is what made the false teachers in Colossae so dangerous. They promised 10 Steps to Fulfill the Ten Commandments. They advertised secret knowledge from spirits and visions. They promised their rules could restrain the unruly flesh. The false teachers sold snake oil—they held out the hope of life, but it was a lie. In Colossians 2:16–23, Paul exposes the false hope of the false teachers by pointing to the true hope in Jesus Christ.</description>

      <description>Colossians 2:6–7 is the main thesis in Colossians. Here, Paul has arrived at his purpose for writing. The main point is this: continue to hope in Christ, for he is supreme and sufficient.
In the first part of the letter, Paul points believers back to how they received Christ (1:5–7, 23, 2:5). He does this to build their confidence in “the faith” they received. In saying, &amp;ldquo;walk in him,&amp;rdquo; Paul is assuring them they are on the right path to salvation and glory.</description>

      <description>Paul here relates his suffering and toil directly to the lives of the Colossian believers. Paul is not looking for sympathy or pity, but is telling his story “that [your] hearts may be encouraged” (2:2). This seems counter-intuitive. Many of us have experienced someone telling us how hard they worked for our benefit. Those of us who are parents have probably told our kids how great our struggle was on their behalf.</description>

      <description>Paul wrote the letter to the Colossians during his time in prison (4:3). He suffered much for the gospel (2 Cor 11:23–33). Yet here, Paul rejoices in his sufferings. Why? He rejoices because he sees his personal sufferings in the context of the cosmic plan of God to reconcile all things to himself through Jesus (1:20, 25).
This plan was formerly a mystery (1:26), but was revealed to the saints when Jesus came, died, rose, and sent the Spirit.</description>

      <description>In the Colossian Hymn (1:15–20), Paul zooms out to see the whole universe of Jesus’s reconciling work. Paul now zooms in to examine the impact of that work on the Colossian believers (and us). He begins with our former state: “alienated and hostile in mind.” Because of the fall, this is the starting point for all human beings. We are all alienated from God by sin. Not only are we alienated, but we are hostile towards God.</description>

      <description>Colossians 1:15–20 is probably the most well-known section of Paul’s letter. Called the Colossian Hymn, this paragraph forms a three-verse hymn echoing the refrain of Christ’s preeminence.
The first verse of the hymn exalts Jesus as the firstborn of the first creation. He is the image of the invisible God and shows us perfectly what our first parents were supposed to be. When God said, “let us make man in our image,” Jesus was the template (Gen 1:26).</description>

      <description>Today was our first full day in Dublin. And it was full indeed. I got my first taste of Irish breakfast at the hotel (bangers, beans, bacon, tomatoes, blood sausage, egg). Then we departed for church service. My group attended City Church Dublin just across the River Liffey from our hotel. We sang together and Pastor Mark preached from Acts 21. City Church Dublin is a small church plant in the heart of the city.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, we departed for Ireland. We met at the airport at 7pm and Pastors David Livingston and Daniel Viezbicke exhorted us from the word and prayed for us. Saying goodbye to family was difficult. The kids handled it pretty well (though Ruby pointed out that we could have sprung to bring a few more kiddos with on the trip). The flight was good. This was my first time flying international. &amp;ldquo;Waking up&amp;rdquo; after only a few hours of sleep and finding out I lost seven hours by crossing time zones was very surreal.</description>

      <description>How many times have you asked someone, “How can I pray for you?” Or how often have you promised to pray and then found yourself unsure of what to pray for? As we meet many in need of prayer in Ireland, what should we pray? In Colossians 1:9–14, Paul shares some of his priorities for prayer for the Colossian church. We can learn how to pray for one another by thinking about Paul’s priorities in prayer.</description>

      <description>Paul begins his letter to the church at Colossae by expressing his thankfulness for their strong faith and abundant love. Paul says this faith and love is “because of the hope laid up for you in heaven” (1:5). What kind of hope could be strong enough to sustain faith in a world marked by suffering? What kind of hope could be strong enough to promote love among sinful people? Paul writes that it is gospel hope.</description>

      <description>After posting online, God used the generosity of donors to bring my funding for Ireland from 45% to 80% in a matter of days. I am so very grateful to all who have donated and all who are praying for the rest of the funds to come in and for the trip to have success.
I have also made some good contacts in Ireland and have a better idea of when and where I will be meeting with folks.</description>

      <description>By supporting Christian workers who go out “for the sake of the name,” you become a “fellow worker for the truth” (3 John 7–8). The cost of my trip is $3,700. This is a small amount if 100 of us share the cost. I’ve already invested my $37. Would you consider joining me by investing $37 or more to support our gospel work in Ireland?

Pray that we may walk worthy of the Lord and so: (1) bear fruit in good works (1:10a); (2) increase in the knowledge of God (1:10b); (3) be strengthened for endurance and patience (1:11); and (4) give joyful thanks to God (1:12).</description>

      <description>This June, I am traveling with the Bethlehem Baptist Church choir to proclaim the name of Jesus in Ireland. I will provide pastoral leadership for our team, deliver gospel teachings, and meet with Irish church leaders, missionaries, and planters.
Ireland is a land of remarkable beauty and history. The Irish people are welcoming and warm hearted. Yet, for all the beauty and cultural richness, Ireland is a land of deep suffering.</description>

      <description>I am grateful to the Lord for allowing me to set aside time for focused and intensive study into His Word and for the Godly men I will be learning from at Bethlehem College and Seminary. As Nicole and I prayerfully considered which seminary would best prepare me for future ministry, BCS was distinctive in several key areas.

      <description>Nicole and I met in middle school through a mutual friend. We lived in different cities, but often visited each other. We steadily grew in our friendship and eventually married the summer after graduation from High School. During the early years of our marriage, Nicole worked at Taste of Seattle as a Baker and I went to school at Saint Cloud State University for a B.S. in Special Education. Our dream was to start a family and in 2006 we had our first child, Malachi.</description>
